      "description": "My name is Thomas Basham, I‚Äôm a Software Developer based in the Seattle area and I‚Äôm also a US Army Veteran. Before I learned how to write code, I made houses and commercial buildings beautiful with my carpentry skills. I enjoy making things and I have a curious mind, which is why one day while looking for other options in life things pointed to Software Development. I love a good mental challenge, and I like to learn as fast as possible so that‚Äôs why I picked a bootcamp to start my journey into coding and the experience has been transformative. ",
